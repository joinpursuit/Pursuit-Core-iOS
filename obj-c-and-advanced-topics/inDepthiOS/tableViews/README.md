# 1. Reusable Cells Motivation

A common iOS interview question might be "Explain what the line below does":

```swift
tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "myCellID", for: indexPath)
```

You've used this before on projects that you built, but why bother using this API instead of just creating a new Table View Cell?  Consider the following two implementations:

```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    guard let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "userCell", for: indexPath) as? UserTableViewCell else {
        fatalError("Unexpected reuse identifier")
    }    
    let user = users[indexPath.row]
    cell.configureCell(with: user)
    return cell
}
```

```swift
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let cell = UserTableViewCell()
    let user = users[indexPath.row]
    cell.configureCell(with: user)
    return cell
}
```

In the first version, we implement `tableView(_:cellForRowAt)` with our usual pattern.  In the second, we make a Table View Cell directly.  Both versions will work correctly and load our cells as specified.  So why use the first version?

It takes work to create a Table View cell.  In the second code snippet we create a new `UserTableViewCell` every time we need to display a new cell.  This is not recommended by Apple practices:

> For performance reasons, a table view’s data source should generally reuse UITableViewCell objects when it assigns cells to rows in its > tableView(\_:cellForRowAt:) method

So how does reusing cells work?

# 2. Reusing Table View Cells

![reuseCells](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/41-solve-duplicated-cell/reuseProcess.png)

The method's name `dequeueReusableCell` gives a hint to the implementation.  Remember that a [queue](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-DSA/tree/master/lessons/Queues/ios) is a data structure where the first element to enter is the first element to leave (like a line at a grocery store).  Whenever a Table View cell disappears off the top of the screen, the cell is placed into a queue.  When a new cell needs to be shown to the user, we `dequeue` the cell at the front of the line, then add it to the bottom.  This is why you may see cells have duplicated information: because you didn't clean the cell of its previous information before reusing it.

# 3. Diffable Data Source

iOS 12 introduced a new way of creating a data source for a Table View.  Most companies probably will not yet be using this method, but understanding that it's out there would be an asset in the interview process.

We can create an instance of a `UITableViewDiffableDataSource`, and set it as the data source for a Table View.  It has the following initializer:

```swift
init(tableView: UITableView,
     cellProvider: @escaping UITableViewDiffableDataSource<SectionIdentifierType, ItemIdentifierType>.CellProvider)
```

Pass in the Table View you want to link it to alongside a closure.  The closure is a type alias for the type below:

```swift
typealias UITableViewDiffableDataSource<SectionIdentifierType, ItemIdentifierType>.CellProvider = (UITableView, IndexPath, ItemIdentifierType) -> UITableViewCell?
```

Create a UITableViewDiffableDataSource with a `Section` type and an `Item` type.  In the example below, we'll use a `Season` and `Episode` respectively.

In order to update our Table View, instead of using `reloadData` we can use a `NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot`.  `reloadData` can perform slowly because you have to update the entire Table View.

Let's look at an example of an app that combines these:

# 4. Building an app with `UITableViewDiffableDataSource`

The app below will load episodes from the office into a Table View.

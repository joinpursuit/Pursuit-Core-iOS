### Exercise

Copy and paste the code below into a Playground in XCode (instructions above), then solve each problem.

  *If Playgrounds aren't working for you, complete the exercises in [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/swift) 
and save your answers in a separate file.

```swift

// Example Problem: Declare a constant called "c4qHQ" that holds the string "Long Island City". Print "c4qHQ"

let c4qHQ = "Long Island City"
print(c4qHQ)


// Problem 1. Declare a variable string called "str" that holds the string "Hello, Playground"

// Problem 2. Declare a variable integer called "one" that holds the value 1

// Problem 3. Change "one" value to 4

// Problem 4. Change "one" value to 1.2 (hint: you might need to change "one"'s declaration first)

// Problem 5. Declare a let constant string called "name" that holds your full name.

// Problem 6. Create a let constant called "age" and give it the value of your age.

// Problem 7. Using the code below, create a variable 'aboutMe' that contains your name and age.

let aboutMe = "My name is \() and I'm \() years old."

// Problem 8. Using the code below, Create variables called "myBestFriendsName" and "myBestFriendsAge" and give them both appropriate values. Insert the correct varia\
bles inside the (). Print "bestFriend".

let bestFriend = "My best friend is \() years old and her name is \()."


// Problem 9. Create a Bool variable called "aliensAreReal" and give it a value. Print "aliensAreReal".

// Problem 10. Describe your hometown. 
// a. Create a string called "townName" which holds your town's name. 

// b. Create an integer variable called "population" and give it a value. 

// c. (Why should "population" be a variable instead of a constant?) 
// Answer (not code):

// d. Create a constant called "numberOfSchools" and give it a value. 

// e. Using the code below, create a variable called "townDescription" below and insert the correct constant or variable, then print.

let townDescription = "My hometown is \() and has a population of \(). There are \() schools in town."

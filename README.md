# Access Code 3.2: Mobile Development with iOS

Today's lesson is on [Dictionaries](/lessons/dictionaries). 

This afternoon Liz will lead you in Industry Readiness stuff.

This evening is your Meetup.

And tomorrow (Friday), we'll review and have an assessment and a short day (!). We're
aware of the tightness of this schedule and are preparing the assessment with it in mind.

# Jargon

- **argument**: An input passed to a function in a call to it, related to parameter. A function can take zero, one or many arguments. Most languages also provide a way to pass a variable number of arguments. 

- **command line interface**: A text based interface to the operating system. Programs or commands are invoked by typing them. There is a long and rich history of using these simple programs and even using them in combination. A rough synonym for console. 

- **console**: A text based interface to the operating system. A rough synonym for command line. 

- **dictionary**: A synonym for an [associative data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array), which maps keys to values.

- **foo**: A common placeholder name used for variables and functions when the actual name isn't important. See [foobar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar).

- **high level**: 
    1. An overview with less detail. Ex., "We're going to discuss the requirements on a high level before we get into the implementation."
    1. When used to describe languages and technology it often indicates a simpler means of doing something.

- **holy war**: An unsolvable debate about some aspect of computing that has strong adherents in more than one camp. It's good to recognize when an issue is one of style or choice and when it's being presented otherwise. For example, iOS vs. Android (mobile OSs/phones), Mac vs. PC (computers), spaces vs. tabs (code formatting), vi vs. Emacs (text editors).

- **[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) = Hypertext Transport Protocol**: The TCP-based network protocol used to transmit web pages and other resources over the Internet.

- **low level**: Using technology that's more basic and "closer to the machine." It's often used to compare programming languages. C is a low level language as compared to JavaScript. This implies it's more challenging to use and more at risk to crash.

- **native**: We distinguish a native app from a web-based solution. Native apps have the potential to perform better with more complicated and sophisticated features and interfaces. The contrast is a cross-platform or web-based app. 

- **parameter**: An input to a function, specifically in its definition, related to argument. A function can define zero, one or many parameters. Most languages also provide a way to pass a variable number of arguments. 

- **set**: v. To assign a value to a variable.
	adv. The state in which a variable has a value. For example, the variable numberOfHamburgers is currently set (it is equal to 10). This is in contrast to unset/nil/null.
